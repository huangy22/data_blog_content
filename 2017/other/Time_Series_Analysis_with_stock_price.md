In this blog post, we will introduce a popular time series model, the ARIMA model to predict stock price and demonstrate a step-by-step process of ARIMA modeling using a R package forecast.

### Time Series Modeling
A time series is a collection of observations of well-defined data items obtained through repeated measurements over time. For example, measuring the value of retail sales each month of the year would comprise a time series. 

Forecasting involves predicting values for a variable using its historical data points or it can also involve predicting the change in one variable given the change in the value of another variable. Time series forecasting falls under the category of quantitative forecasting wherein statistical principals and concepts are applied to a given historical data of a variable to forecast the future values of the same variable. Some time series models include:

* Autoregressive (AR) Model
* Moving Average (MA) Model
* Seasonal Regression Model
* Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) Model
