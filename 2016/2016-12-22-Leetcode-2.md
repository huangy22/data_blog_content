## [Find The Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

### Problem
 Given two strings $s$ and $t$ which consist of only lowercase letters. String $t$ is generated by random shuffling string $s$ and then add one more letter at a random position. Find the letter that was added in $t$.

### Solution (Char to Integer) 
**Time complexity**: $O(size(s)+size(t))$, **space**: $O(1)$.

Use `int(char)` to transfer a character to a integer. Compare the difference between `sum(int(s[:]))` and `sum(int(t[:]))`, and get the additional character using `char(sum(t)-sum(s))`.

``` cpp
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++){
            sum -= int(s[i]);
            sum += int(t[i]);
        }
        sum += int(t[t.size()-1]);
        return char(sum);
    }
```

## [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

### Problem
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

### Solution (Pointers)
**Time complexity**: $O(n)$, **space**: $O(1)$.

Use two pointers fast and slow. Fast is always n nodes ahead of slow. When `fast` hits `NULL`, `slow\-\>next` is the one need to be deleted.

``` cpp
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        ListNode dummy(0);
        ListNode *slow, *fast;
        slow = &dummy;
        fast = &dummy;
        // use a dummy pointer in case the head need to be removed
        dummy.next = head;

        // make fast n ahead of slow
        while(n>=0){
            fast = fast->next;
            n--;
        }
        // move fast and slow together until fast hits the end
        while(fast){
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        // remove slow->next
        if(slow->next!=NULL){
            slow->next = slow->next->next;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
```

## [Fizz Buzz](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/)

### Problem 
Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.

But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

### Solution
**Time complexity**: $O(n)$.

Simple iteration and if-else conditions. 

``` cpp
    vector<string> fizzBuzz(int n) {
        vector< string > vec(n,"");
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
            if(i%3!=0 && i%5!=0){
                vec[i-1] += std::to_string(i);
            }else{
                if(i%3==0) vec[i-1] += "Fizz";
                if(i%5==0) vec[i-1] += "Buzz";
            }
        }
        return vec;
    }
```

## [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

### Problem
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

### Solution 1 (Extra Space $O(n)$)
With `s.size()` given, it is easy to get s[i] in a reversed iteration. 

``` cpp
    string reverseString(string s) {
        string str="";
        int len=s.size();
        for(int i=len-1; i>=0; i--){
            str += s[i];
        }
        return str;
    }
```

### Solution 2 (In-Place)
Iterate both from the head and tail, swap  s[i++] and s[j--].

``` cpp
    string reverseString(string s) {
        int i =0, j = s.size()-1;
        char temp;
        while(i<j){
            temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[j];
            s[j] = temp;
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return s;
    }
```

## [Nim Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/)

### Problem
You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.

For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.

### Solution 
If the number of stones are not 4n, you can always take the $mod(number, 4)$ for the first round, see how many stones your friend takes, for example i, and take $4-i$ next time. But if the total number is $4 \times integer$, you can not win.


## [Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

### Problem 
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example:
For num = 5 you should return `[0,1,1,2,1,2]`.

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time $O(n\*sizeof(integer))$. But can you do it in linear time $O(n)$ /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be $O(n)$.
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like `__builtin_popcount` in c++ or in any other language.

### Solution (Bit Manipulation, Recursive)
**Time complexity**: $O(n)$, **space complexity**: $O(n)$.
Think recursively. Suppose you have the array for $[0,2^n-1]$. The array for $[2^n, 2^{(n+1)}-1]$ will be all the elements in the array for $[0, 2^n-1] $ plus one. 

``` cpp
    vector<int> countBits(int num) {
        vector<int> res;
        if(num>=0){
            res.push_back(0);
        }
        int step=1;
        // step take values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...]
        while(step <= num){
            for(int i=0; i<step; i++){
                res.push_back(res[i]+1);
            }
            step *= 2;
        }
        // remove the extra part from n+1 to step
        for(int i= step-1; i>num; i--){
            res.erase(res.begin()+i);
        }
        return res;
    }
```

## [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

### Problem
Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,
Given input array nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

### Solution
**Time complexity** : $O(n)$, **space**: $O(1)$.
In c++ there's a range-based iteration `for(int n : nums)` for a vector nums which is very convenient to use here. 

``` cpp
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i=0;
        for(int n : nums){
            if(i==0 || n>nums[i-1]){
                nums[i++] = n;
            }
        }
        return i;
    }
```

## [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

### Problem
Given $n$ non-negative integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, where each represents a point at coordinate $(i, a_i)$. $n$ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line $i$ is at $(i, a_i)$ and $(i, 0)$. Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

### Solution 1
**Time complexity**: $O(n)$.

Start with the widest container, which is $a\_0$ and $a\_{n-1}$. In order to get a bigger container than this one, we need to move the head or tail toward the center and hope to find a higher height than the current head and tail. In each iteration, always move the lower one toward the center. If move the higher one, the width will be smaller, and the height will still be no bigger than the lower one, there's no way to find a bigger container.

``` cpp
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int n = height.size();
        int head=0, tail=n-1;
        int max = 0, newarea = 0, lower = 0;
        while(head < tail){
            lower = height[head]>height[tail]? height[tail]:height[head];
            newarea = (tail-head)*lower;
            if(newarea > max)
                max = newarea;
            height[head]<height[tail]? head++: tail--;
        }
        return max;
    }
```

### Solution 2
**Time complexity**: $O(n)$, but with a smaller prefactor compared to solution 1.

In fact, when we move head or tail toward the center (width will always be decreasing), we can securely skip all the bars that are lower than the current lower one. Only compute the area after we find a new higher height than the current lower one (head or tail), otherwise just jump over.

``` cpp
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int n = height.size();
        int head=0, tail=n-1;
        int max = 0, newarea = 0, lower = 0;
        while(head < tail){
            lower = height[head]>height[tail]? height[tail]:height[head];
            newarea = (tail-head)*lower;
            if(newarea > max)
                max = newarea;
            while(height[head]<=lower) head++;
            while(height[tail]<=lower) tail--;
        }
        return max;
    }
```
