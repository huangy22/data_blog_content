This project can help the users to learn about the research history inphysics and identify interesting fields. After identify a subfield which ispotentially interesting, the visualizations of the community networks canhelp the users to find out the top physicists and groups that are workingon the selected field, papers with the most impact in the field, the topinstitutions that the top physicists are working in, and learn about thecollaboration relationship in the community.
