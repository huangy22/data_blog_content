In my previous blog post [A Journey From Physics To Data Science (Part I)](http://yuanhuangblog.com/2018/03/18/Journey-From-Physics-To-DS-I/) I talked about my preparations to transition from a Ph.D. student in computational condensed matter physics to a machine learning engineer. Through the journey, one of the biggest move for me is to participate in the 7-week [Insight Data Science Program](https://www.insightdatascience.com/) during the summer of 2017. In this blog post, I will talk about what Insight is and how it helped me to land on a job as a machine learning engineer at a data-driven personal styling company [Dia&Co](https://www.dia.com/welcome).

## Interview for Insight Data Science

I learned about Insight through a friend in graduate school who speaks highly of the program. I also searched online and found several blog posts and Quora question and answers talking about all the good things about it. I really like that the bootcamp can provide us opportunities to get in touch of companies from different business domain and help us to build a project that can showcase our skills. So I applied for the 2017 Summer Insight Data Science program at NYC at the end of March. 

The interview process is quite straightforward. First you submit an online application, and fill in all your research and data science related experiences and your interest in data science. Then I was invited for a Skype interview for 30 minutes. The interview will include a "Analysis Demo" which is an interactive demonstration of a data analysis work with data exploration, modeling, visualizations, etc. Another part of the interview will be about a brief overview of my research experience and data related project experience.

For the data analysis demo, instead of showing my research work (which I thought might be too hard to explain within 10 mins), I prepared a very straightforward machine learning analysis on a small dataset about red and white wine. The dataset is from one of course project for the data visualization course I took at UMass, and in that course I've already made a interactive visualization website to explore the data. Based on that, I built a couple of machine learning models using sklearn to predict the wine quality and performed cross validation and model selection and performance analysis. There's nothing fancy in the demo, but this straightforward machine learning pipeline involves all the necessary components in data science analysis. 

I also put quite some efforts to prepare my research introduction. My research area is numerical studies on quantum many body systems, and more specifically to represent those systems in different representations (such as path-integrals, Feynman diagrams, etc.) and use quantum Monte Carlo sampling to calculate them. I brainstormed with all the colleagues in the office and they gave me a lot of great ideas on explaining what is a quantum many body system and what are the difficulties to study them. Luckily the Insight interviewer was also from a related background (ultracold atom experiments) and he was quite impressed by our approach and we ended up having a great conversation about my research.

One day later I received the offer from Insight. While I'm still hesitating, the program director also connected me with an alumni through skype and gave me a chance to hear about his experience about Insight. All the great conversations helped me to make my mind to participate in the Insight Data Science program in the summer at NYC.

One takeaway from the interview process with Insight is I feel that they value highly about the communication skills besides research and technical skills. After I joined Insight and met all my Insight fellows, I am amazed that everyone is giving really great presentations and so easy to communicate with.

## Data Projects
During the first four weeks at Insight, the main task for us is to build a data science project that collects data from somewhere (could be either open source data, from web scrapping, or from a consultant company), processes the data, builds some algorithms or/and models to accomplish some task, and hosts the product on a website. There are many fascinating projects that Insight alumnus have built over the years and many of them are published as [blog posts](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/). For building the projects, a variety of skills will be needed, such as SQL, machine learning models, Flask. Recommending systems, natural language processing, computer vision, time-series analysis are also getting quite popular as project ideas.

I have talked about my Insight project in a separate blog post, [A News Recommendation Engine Driven By Collaborative Reader Behavior](http://yuanhuangblog.com/2018/03/18/News-Recommendation-Engine/). For my project, I combined collaborative filtering with content-based filtering to develop a recommendation engine for news articles based on user behavior. In this project I used several machine learning techniques including LDA topic modeling and unsupervised clustering techniques.

One thing to notice, there's no actual lectures or classes given by the program, and we are gonna need to learn from our peers, learn from books and internet, and learn by doing.

## Company Visits

While we were working on the projects, companies that are hiring data scientists will come to the Insight office and talk about data science at their company. It really provided me a great opportunity to learn more about different business domain and companies beyond the online job descriptions and see how different the role of a data scientist is across companies.

Because of the company visits, the first four weeks of the program was quite an intense experience. There are always a lot of events on the calendars everyday and we also need to finish a project at the same time. In fact I had to pull out some long nights and weekends collecting the data, coding, and building the front end. But I would say it's totally worth it. This tight timeline also taught me how to prioritize in my project. The idea of building a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and iterate based on that is really necessary for the success of a project.

## Project Demos

Starting from week 5, we are giving demos about our projects at about 7-8 companies (the companies are selected based on a company list we filled out in the first month). After that, the companies are giving call backs for job interviews to the fellows they are interested in.

## Job Interview Preparations

While giving demos, we also started to prepare for the real job interviews. The most important areas to study for the interviews include machine learning, statistics, computer science, SQL and behavioral questions.

At Insight, it's fascinating to have fellows from different backgrounds and with different expertise. We formed into study groups, had discussion sessions, conducted mock interviews in pairs, practiced whiteboard coding and SQL together. It's so much fun to learn with peers, and especially when you can learn stats from a stats PhD, or practice coding with someone who excels at many Coding and Algorithm Contests!

## Alumni Mentorship and Community

Throughout the whole program, Insight alumni will come back to Insight office as mentors. They provide feedbacks for our projects in the first four weeks, and help to conduct mock interviews on different topics later on. It was a great opportunity for us to connect to data scientists at different companies, and it's also great to learn about their experience working as a data scientist at different companies. I still kept connections with some of the mentors I met and am really grateful for all the help they provided. Now since I started working as a machine learning engineer at Dia&Co, I also come back to Insight to provide mentorship for the new cohorts. It's always exciting to meet new friends in the data science field and hear about their projects since the field is evolving so fast and every time there are so many new techniques coming out!

My overall experience at Insight is quite positive and I really appreciate the help from the program directors, and current and previous Insight fellows in all the stages of the job seeking process. Insight really helped me to navigate the job market, connected me to different companies, and helped me to build the connections with all the Insight fellows and alumnus. 

The most valuable thing Insight has provided me is a fascinating data science community that I feel strongly engaged with. I remain good friends with a lot of my Insight fellows. We meet regularly to chat about data science at different companies and share new techniques we learned. It always feels great to meet some friendly faces and learn something new together!
