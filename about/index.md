My name is Yuan Huang. Currently I am a machine learning engineer working at [Dia&Co](https://www.dia.com/welcome).
Iâ€™ve always been interested in the whole range of tasks related to solving challenging problems especially with the help of big data and machine learning algorithms. 
I am both passionate in diving into the math and theory behind the scene and in actually building the algorithm and turning it into product. 

Before working as a machine learning engineer, I got a Ph.D. in Quantum Information at University of Science and Technology of China in 2016, and a Ph.D. in condensed matter physics at University of Massachusetts, Amherst in May 2018.
